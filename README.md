# fedelemflowlist
`fedelemflowlist` is a Python package that generates and provides a standardized elementary flow for use in life cycle assessment data
 as well as mappings to convert data from other sources. This list supports the [Federal LCA Commons](http://www.lcacommons.gov), 
 where the active version of the flow list can be found. 

 Standard formats for a [Flow List](./format%20specs/FlowList.md)
 and a [Flow Mapping](./format%20specs/FlowMapping.md) are defined and used. 
 
 The version of the package (see [Releases](./releases/)) corresponds to the version of the flow list that it provides.
 
 The background and methodology behind creation of the flow list, as well as a summary of the flow list itself can be
  found in the USEPA Report
  ['The Federal LCA Commons Elementary Flow List: Background, Approach, Description and Recommendations for Usage'](https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_search_results.cfm?simpleSearch=0&showCriteria=2&searchAll=elementary+flows&TIMSType=Published+Report&dateBeginPublishedPresented=07%2F31%2F2019)
 
See the [Wiki](./wiki/) for installation and use instructions.
